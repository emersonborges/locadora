</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL has many modes of operation and features that allow it to
    be used in very different scenarios. Levels of memory usage, speed and
    accessibility by different applications are influenced by how HyperSQL is
    deployed.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N13E51"></a>Mode of Operation</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The decision to run HyperSQL as a separate server process or as an
      <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database should be based on the
      following:</p>
<p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>When HyperSQL is run as a server on a separate machine, it
            is isolated from hardware failures and crashes on the hosts
            running the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When HyperSQL is run as a server on the same machine, it is
            isolated from application crashes and memory leaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server connections are slower than
            <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connections due to the overhead
            of streaming the data for each JDBC call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can reduce client/server traffic using SQL Stored
            procedures to reduce the number of JDBC execute calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During development, it is better to use a Server with
            server.silent=false, which displays the statements sent to the
            server on the console window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To improve speed of execution for statements that are
            executed repeatedly, reuse a parameterized PreparedStatement for
            the lifetime of the connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="N13E70"></a>Tables</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>TEXT tables are designed for special applications where the data
      has to be in an interchangeable format, such as CSV (comma separated
      values). TEXT tables should not be used for routine storage of
      data.</p>
<p>MEMORY tables and CACHED tables are generally used for data
      storage. The difference between the two is as follows:</p>
<p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The data for all MEMORY tables is read from the *.script
            file when the database is started and stored in memory. In
            contrast the data for cached tables is not read into memory until
            the table is accessed. Furthermore, only part of the data for each
            CACHED table is held in memory, allowing tables with more data
            than can be held in memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the database is shutdown in the normal way, all the
            data for MEMORY tables is written out to the disk. In comparison,
            the data in CACHED tables that has changed is written out during
            operation and at shutdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The size and capacity of the data cache for all the CACHED
            tables is configurable. This makes it possible to allow all the
            data in CACHED tables to be cached in memory. In this case, speed
            of access is good, but slightly slower than MEMORY tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For normal applications it is recommended that MEMORY tables
            are used for small amounts of data, leaving CACHED tables for
            large data sets. For special applications in which speed is
            paramount and a large amount of free memory is available, MEMORY
            tables can be used for large tables as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N13E85"></a>Large Objects</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 supports dedicated storage and access to BLOB and
      CLOB objects. These objects can have huge sizes. BLOB or CLOB is
      specified as the type of a column of the table. Afterwards, rows can be
      inserted into the table using a PreparedStatement for efficient transfer
      of large LOB data to the database. In <em class="glossterm">mem:</em>
      catalogs, CLOB and BLOB data is stored in memory. In
      <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalogs, this data is stored in a single
      separate file which has the extension *.lobs. The size of this file can
      grow to huge, terabyte figures.</p>
<p>LOB data should be store in the database using a JDBC
      PreparedStatement object. The streaming methods send the LOB to the
      database in one operation as a binary or character stream. Inside the
      database, the disk space is allocated as needed and the data is saved as
      it is being received. LOB data should be retrieved from the database
      using a JDBC ResultSet method. When a streaming method is used to
      retrieve a LOB, it is retrieved in large chunks in a transparent manner.
      LOB data can also be stored by calling a JDBC method with String or
      byte[] argument, but these methods limit the size of the LOB that can be
      stored or retrieved.</p>
<p>LOB data is not duplicated in the database when a lob is copied
      from one table to another. The disk space is reused when a LOB is
      deleted and is no longer contained in any table. This happens only at
      the time of a CHECKPOINT.</p>
<p>By using a dedicated LOB store, HyperSQL achieves consistently
      high speeds (usually over 20MB / s) for both storage and retrieval of
      LOBs.</p>
<p>By default, the internal LOB schema is stored in the database as
      MEMORY tables. Therefore the amount of JVM memory should be increased
      when more than tens of thousands of LOBs are stored in the database. If
      your database contains more than a few hundreds of thousands of LOBs and
      memory use becomes an issue, you can change one or all LOB schema tables
      to CACHED tables. See the next section for details.</p>

<a name="N13E98"></a>Deployment context</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The files used for storing HyperSQL database data are all in the
      same directory. New files are always created and deleted by the database
      engine. Two simple principles must be observed:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The Java process running HyperSQL must have full privileges on
          the directory where the files are stored. This include create and
          delete privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file system must have enough spare room both for the
          'permanent' and 'temporary' files. The default maximum size of the
          *.log file is 50MB. The *.data file can grow to up to 16GB (more if
          the default has been increased). The .backup file can be up to the
          size of the *.data file. The *.lobs file can grow to several
          terabytes. The temporary files created at the time of a SHUTDOWN can
          be equal in size to the *.script file and the .data file.</p>

<a name="N13EA4"></a>Readonly Databases</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalog can be made readonly
      permanently, or it can be opened as readonly. To make the database
      readonly, the property, value pair, readonly=true can be added to the
      .properties file of the database.</p>
<p>It is also possible to open a normal database as readonly. For
      this, the property can be included in the URL of the first connection to
      the database.</p>
<p>There is another option which allows MEMORY tables to be writable,
      but without persisting the changes at SHUTDOWN. This option is activated
      with the property, value pair, <code class="literal">files_readonly= true</code>,
      which can be added to the .properties file of the database, or included
      in the URL of the first connection to the database. This option is
      useful for running application tests which operate on a predefined
      dataset.</p>

<a name="N13EB7" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>Memory used by the program can be thought of as two distinct pools:
    memory used for table data which is not released unless the data is
    deleted and memory that can be released or is released automatically,
    including memory used for caching, building result sets and other internal
    operations such as storing the information needed for a rollback a
    transaction.</p>
<p>Most JVM implementations allocate up to a maximum amount of memory
    (usually 64 MB by default). This amount is generally not adequate when
    large memory tables are used, or when the average size of rows in cached
    tables is larger than a few hundred bytes. The maximum amount of allocated
    memory can be set on the Java command line that is used for running
    HyperSQL. For example, with Sun JVM, parameter -Xmx256m increases the
    amount to 256 MB.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N13EBF"></a>Table Memory Allocation</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The memory used for a MEMORY table is the sum of memory used by
      each row. Each MEMORY table row is a Java object that has 2 int or
      reference variables. It contains an array of objects for the fields in
      the row. Each field is an object such as <code class="classname">Integer</code>,
      <code class="classname">Long</code>, <code class="classname">String</code>, etc. In
      addition each index on the table adds a node object to the row. Each
      node object has 6 int or reference variables. As a result, a table with
      just one column of type INTEGER will have four objects per row, with a
      total of 10 variables of 4 bytes each - currently taking up 80 bytes per
      row. Beyond this, each extra column in the table adds at least a few
      bytes to the size of each row.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N13ECD"></a>Result Set Memory Allocation</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, all the rows in the result set are built in memory, so
      very large result sets may not be possible to build. In server mode
      databases, by default, the result set memory is released from the server
      once the database server has returned the result set.
      <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> databases release the memory when the
      application program releases the
      <code class="classname">java.sql.ResultSet</code> object. Server modes require
      additional memory for returning result sets, as they convert the full
      result set into an array of bytes which is then transmitted to the
      client.</p>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 supports disk-based result sets. The commands,
      <code class="literal">SET SESSION RESULT MEMORY ROWS &lt;integer&gt;</code> and
      <code class="literal">SET DATABASE DEFAULT RESULT MEMORY ROWS
      &lt;integer&gt;</code> specify a threshold for the number of rows.
      Results with row counts above the threshold are stored on disk. These
      settings also apply to temporary tables and subquery tables.</p>
<p>When the setFetchSize() method of the Statement interface is used
      to limit the number rows fetched, the whole result is held by the engine
      and is returned to the JDBC ResultSet in blocks of rows of the specified
      fetch size. Disk-based result sets slow down the database operations and
      should be used only when absolutely necessary, perhaps with result sets
      that are larger than tens of thousands of rows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N13EE2"></a>Temporary Memory Use During Operations</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When UPDATE and DELETE queries are performed on CACHED tables, the
      full set of rows that are affected, including those affected due to ON
      UPDATE actions, is held in memory for the duration of the operation.
      This means it may not be possible to perform deletes or updates
      involving very large numbers of rows of CACHED tables. Such operations
      should be performed in smaller sets.</p>
<p>When transactions support is enabled with SET AUTOCOMMIT FALSE,
      lists of all insert, delete or update operations are stored in memory so
      that they can be undone when ROLLBACK is issued. For CACHED tables, only
      the transaction information is held in memory, not the actual rows that
      have changed. Transactions that span thousands of modification to data
      will take up a lot of memory until the next COMMIT or ROLLBACK clears
      the list. Each row modification uses less than 100 bytes until
      COMMIT.</p>
<p>When subqueries or views are used in SELECT and other statements,
      transient tables are created and populated by the engine. If the
      <code class="literal">SET SESSION RESULT MEMORY ROWS &lt;integer&gt;</code>
      statement has been used, these transient tables are stored on disk when
      they are larger than the threshold.</p>

<a name="N13EEE"></a>Data Cache Memory Allocation</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With CACHED tables, the data is stored on disk and only up to a
      maximum number of rows are held in memory at any time. The default is up
      to 50,000 rows. The SET FILES CACHE ROWS command or the
      <span class="property">hsqldb.cache_rows</span> connection property can be set to
      alter this amount. As any random subset of the rows in any of the CACHED
      tables can be held in the cache, the amount of memory needed by cached
      rows can reach the sum of the rows containing the largest field data.
      For example if a table with 100,000 rows contains 40,000 rows with 1,000
      bytes of data in each row and 60,000 rows with 100 bytes in each, the
      cache can grow to contain 50,000 of the smaller rows, but as explained
      further, only 10,000 or the large rows.</p>
<p>An additional property, <span class="property">hsqldb.cache_size</span> is
      used in conjunction with the <span class="property">hsqldb.cache_rows</span>
      property. This puts a limit in bytes on the total size of rows that are
      cached. The default values is 10,000KB. (This is the size of binary
      images of the rows and indexes. It translates to more actual memory,
      typically 2-4 times, used for the cache because the data is represented
      by Java objects.)</p>
<p>If memory is limited, the <span class="property">hsqldb.cache_rows</span>
      or <span class="property">hsqldb.cache_size</span> database properties can be
      reduced. In the example above, if the
      <span class="property">hsqldb.cache_size</span> is reduced from 10,000 to 5,000,
      it will allow the number of cached rows to reach 50,000 small rows, but
      only 5,000 of the larger rows.</p>
<p>Data for CLOB and BLOB columns is not cached and does not affect
      the CACHED table memory cache.</p>
<p>The use of Java nio file access method also increases memory
      usage. Access with nio improves database update speed and is used by
      default for data files up to 256 MB. For minimal memory use, nio access
      should be disabled.</p>

<p>HyperSQL uses a set of fast pools for immutable objects such as
      Integer, Long and short String objects that are stored in the database.
      In most circumstances, this reduces the memory footprint still further
      as fewer copies of the most frequently-used objects are kept in memory.
      The object pools are shared among all databases in the JVM. The size of
      each pool can be modified only by altering and recompiling the
      <code class="literal">org.hsqldb.store.ValuePool</code> class.</p>

<a name="N13F15"></a>Lob Memory Usage</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Access to lobs is always performed in chunks, so it is perfectly
      possible to store and access a CLOB or BLOB that is larger than the JVM
      memory allocation. The actual total size of lobs is almost unlimited. We
      have tested with over 100 GB of lobs without any loss of
      performance.</p>
<p>By default, HyperSQL 2.0 uses memory-based tables for the lob
      schema (not the actual lob data). Therefore it is practical to store
      about 100,000 individual lobs in the database with the default JVM
      memory allocation. More lobs can be stored with larger JVM memory
      allocations. In order to store more than a few hundreds of thousands of
      lobs, you can change the lob schema storage to CACHED tables with the
      following statements:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In all running modes (server or <em class="glossterm">in-process</em>)
    multiple connections to the database engine are supported.
    <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> (standalone) mode supports connections
    from the client in the same Java Virtual Machine, while server modes
    support connections over the network from several different
    clients.</p>
<p>Connection pooling software can be used to connect to the database
    but it is not generally necessary. Connection pools may be used for the
    following reasons.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>To allow new queries to be performed while a time-consuming
        query is being performed in the background. In HyperSQL, blocking
        depends on the transaction control model, the isolation level, and the
        current activity by other sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To limit the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the
        database for performance reasons. With HSQLDB this can be useful if
        your application is designed in a way that opens and closes
        connections for each small task. Also, the overall performance may be
        higher when fewer simultaneous connections are used. If you want to
        reduce the number of simultaneous sessions, you can use a connection
        pool with fewer pooled connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>An application that is not both multi-threaded and transactional,
    such as an application for recording user login and logout actions, does
    not need more than one connection. The connection can stay open
    indefinitely and reopened only when it is dropped due to network
    problems.</p>
<p>When using an <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database, when the
    last connection to the database is closed, the database still remains
    open. An explicit SHUTDOWN command, with or without an argument, is
    required to close the database. A connection property on the connection
    URL or in a properties object can be used to shutdown the database when
    the last connection is closed.</p>
<p>When using a server database (and to some extent, an
    <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database), care must be taken to avoid
    creating and dropping JDBC Connections too frequently. Failure to observe
    this will result in poor performance when the application is under heavy
    load.</p>
<p>A common error made by users in load-test simulations is to use a
    single client machine to open and close thousands of connections to a
    HyperSQL server instance. The connection attempts will fail after a few
    thousand because of OS restrictions on opening sockets and the delay that
    is built into the OS in closing them.</p>

<a name="N13F4E"></a>Application Development and Testing</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First thing to be aware of is the SQL conformance settings of
      HyperSQL. By default version 2.0 applies stricter conformance rules than
      version 1.8 and catches long strings or decimal values that do not fit
      within the specified length or precision settings. However, there are
      several conformance settings that are turned off by default. This is to
      enable easier migration from earlier versions, and also greater
      compatibility with databases such as MySQL that are sometimes very
      liberal with type conversions. The conformance settings are listed
      towards the end of this chapter and their connection property
      equivalents are listed in the Database Properties chapter. Ideally, all
      the settings should have a true value for best error checking.</p>
<p>For application unit testing you can use an all-in-memory,
      in-process database.</p>
<p>If the tests are all run in one process, then the contents of a
      <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> database survives between tests. To release
      the contents you can use the SHUTDOWN command (an SQL command). You can
      even use multiple <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> databases in your tests
      and SHUTDOWN each one separately.</p>
<p>If the tests are in different processes and you want to keep the
      data between the tests, the best solution is to use a Server instance
      that has a <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> database. After the tests are
      done, you can SHUTDOWN this database, which will shutdown the
      server.</p>
<p>The Server has an option that allows databases to be created as
      needed by making a connection (see the Listeners Chapter). This option
      is useful for testing, as your server is never shut down. Each time you
      connect to the <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> database that is served by
      the Server, the database is created if it does not exist (i.e. has been
      previously shut down).</p>
<p>If you do not want to run a Server instance, and you need
      persistence between tests in different processes, then you should use a
      <em class="glossterm">file:</em> database. You can use the
      <code class="literal">shutdown=true</code> connection property to ensure the
      database is persisted fully after the connections are closed. An
      alternative option is to use <code class="literal">hsqldb.write_delay=false</code>
      connection property, but this is slightly slower than the other
      option.</p>
<p>It has been reported that some data access frameworks do not close
      all their connection to the database after the tests. In such
      situations, you need to use zero WRITE DELAY if you want the data to
      persist at the end of the tests</p>
<p>You may actually want to use a <em class="glossterm">file:</em>
      database, or a server instance that serves a
      <em class="glossterm">file:</em> database in preference to a
      <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> database. As HyperSQL logs the DDL and DML
      statements in the .log file, this file can be used to check what is
      being sent to the database. Note that UPDATE statements are represented
      by a DELETE followed by an INSERT statement. Statements are written out
      when the connection commits. The write delay also has an effect on how
      soon the statements are written out.</p>
<p>The new SQL logging feature in version 2.1.1 and later records all
      executed statements and can be used for debugging your
      application.</p>
<p>Some types of tests start with a database that already contains
      the tables and data, and perform various operations on it during the
      tests. You can create and populate the initial database then set the
      property "files_readonly=true" in the .properties file of the database.
      The tests can then modify the database, but these modifications are not
      persisted after the tests have completed.</p>

<p>In this usage, the amount of data change is often limited and
      there is often a requirement to persist the data immediately. You can
      use the property <code class="literal">write_delay=false</code> to force a disk
      sync after each commit. Before the application is closed, you should
      perform the SHUTDOWN command to ensure the database is opened instantly

<p>This usage involves a server application, such as a web
      application, connecting to an embedded HyperSQL instance. In this usage,
      the database is often accessed heavily, therefore performance and
      latency is a consideration. If the database is updated heavily, the
      default value of the WRITE DELAY property (0.5 sec) is often enough, as
      it is assumed the server or the application does not go down frequently.
      If it is necessary, you can reduce the WRITE DELAY to a small value (20
      ms) without impacting the update speed. If you reduce WRITE DELAY to
      zero, performance drops to the speed of disk file sync operation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a server application can use an all-in-mem database
      instance for fast access, while sending the data changes to a
      persistent, disk based instance either periodically or in real
      time.</p>

      application and a HyperSQL Server or WebServer without any programming.

<p>All file database that are not readonly, write changes to the .log
      file. There are scenarios where writing to the .log file can be turned
      off to improve performance, especially with larger databases. For these
      applications you can set the property
      <code class="literal">hsqldb.log_data=false</code> to disable the recovery log and
      speed up data change performance. The equivalent SQL command is SET
      FILES LOG FALSE.</p>
<p>With this setting, no data is logged, but all the changes to
      cached tables are written to the .data file. To persist all the data
      changes up to date, you can use the CHECKPOINT command. If you perform
      SHUTDOWN, the data is also persisted correctly. If you do not use
      CHECKPOINT or SHUTDOWN when you terminate the application, all the
      changes are lost and the database reverts to its original state when it
      is opened.</p>
<p>Your server applications can use a database as a temporary disk
      data cache which is not persisted past the lifetime of the application.
      For this usage, delete the database files when the application
      ends.</p>
<p>On some platforms, such as embedded devices which have a reliable
      storage device, this is also a useful option. Your application issues
      CHECKPOINT to save the changes made so far. This method of use reduces
      write operations on SSD devices. For this usage, the lock file should
      also be disabled with the connection property

<b>Procedure&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;Upgrading Databases Created with Version 1.8.x</b>
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Open the database with the jar that created it and perform the
        SHUTDOWN statement as an SQL statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the database with the HyperSQL 2.0 jar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the SHUTDOWN COMPACT statement..</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The first step is to guarantee there is no .log file for the
    database. You may upgrade without the first step, but may lose part of the
    logged statements. This has been allowed due to requests from some of our
    deployers who have been able to test the databases created by their
    applications and found there was no data loss. But this is not recommended
    for general use. Most catalogs created with 1.8.x can be upgraded simply
    by opening with HyperSQL 2.0. After opening with version 2.0, perform a
    SHUTDOWN COMPACT to rewrite the database in the latest format.</p>
<p>In large scale deployed apps undergoing upgrades, it is sometimes
    not practical to perform the first step of this procedure (with the old
    jar). You can ignore the first step but you may lose part of the database
    statements that are stored in the .log file. Therefore you need test with
    databases created with your application to make sure typcial statements
    that are logged in the .log file are compatible with the new version.
    Examples of known incompatible statements are those used for changing the
    data type or default values of column.</p>
<p>When this method is not possible due to errors, the rest of the
    procedures below should be followed.</p>
<p>A note about SHUTDOWN modes. SHUTDOWN COMPACT is equivalent to
    SHUTDOWN SCRIPT plus openning the database and then performing a simple
    SHUTDOWN.</p>
<p>After upgrading a database, you may want to change some of its
    settings. For example, the new SET FILES BACKUP INCREMENT TRUE statement
    can improve the shutdown and checkpoint times of larger databases.</p>
<p>Once a database is upgraded to 2.0, it can no longer be used with
    previous versions of HyperSQL.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To upgrade from version 1.8.x with the default TEXT format script
      files, simply open the database with 2.0. If the version 1.8.x files
      have database script format set to BINARY or COMPRESSED (ZIPPED) you
      must issue the SET SCRIPTFORMAT TEXT and SHUTDOWN SCRIPT commands with
      the old version, then open with the new version of the engine. In most
      cases the upgrade is successful and complete.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to execute SHUTDOWN COMPACT after an
      automatic upgrade from previous versions.</p>
<p>If your database has been created with version 1.7.2 or 1.7.3,
      first upgrade to version 1.8.1 and perform a SHUTDOWN SCRIPT with this
      version. You can then upgrade the database to version 2.0.</p>
<p>To upgrade from older version database files (1.7.1 and older)
      that contain CACHED tables, use the SCRIPT procedure below. In all
      versions of HyperSQL, the <code class="literal">SCRIPT 'filename'</code> command
      (used as an SQL statement) allows you to save a full record of your
      database, including database object definitions and data, to a file of
      your choice. You can export a script file using the old version of the

</div>
</div>
</div>
<a name="N140A0" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>The database engine saves the files containing all the data in a
    file catalog when a shutdown takes place. It automatically recovers from
    an abnormal termination and preserves the data when the catalog is opened
    next time. In an ideal operating environment, where there is no OS crash,
    disk failure, bugs in code, etc. there would be no need regularly to
    backup a database. This is meant to say, the engine performs the routine
    shutdown procedure internally, therefore backing up catalogs is an
    insurance policy against all sorts of misadventure that are not under the
    control of the database engine.</p>
<p>The data for each catalog consists of up to 5 files in the same
    directory with the endings such as <code class="literal">*.properties</code>,
    <code class="literal">*.script</code>, etc., as detailed in previous
    chapters.</p>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 includes commands to backup the database files into
    a single <code class="literal">.tar</code> or <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> file
    archive. The backup can be performed by a command given in a JDBC session
    if the target database catalog is running, or on the command-line if the
    target catalog has been shutdown.</p>

<a name="N14117"></a>Encrypted Databases</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL supports encrypted databases. Encryption services use the
    Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) and uses the ciphers installed with the
    JRE. HyperSQL itself does not contain any cryptography code.</p>
<p>Three elements are involved in specifying the encryption method and
    key. A cipher, together with its configuration is identified by a string
    which includes the name of the cipher and optional parameters. A provider
    is the fully qualified class name of the cipher provider. A key is
    represented as a hexadecimal string.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N1411E"></a>Creating and Accessing an Encrypted Database</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, a key must be created for the desired cipher and
      configuration. This is done by calling the function CRYPT_KEY(&lt;cipher
      spec&gt;, &lt;provider&gt;). If the default provider (the built-in JVM
      ciphers) is used, then NULL should be specified as the provider. The
      CRYPT_KEY function returns a hexadecimal key. The function call can be
      made in any HyperSQL database, so long as the provider class is on the
      classpath. This key can be used to create a new encrypted database.
      Calls to this function always return different keys, based on a
      generated random values.</p>
<p>As an example, a call to CRYPT_KEY('Blowfish', null) returned the
      string, '604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932'. To create a new database,
      the URL below is used:</p>
<p>
<code class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:file:&lt;database
      path&gt;;crypt_key=604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932;crypt_type=blowfish</code>
</p>
<p>The third property name is crypt_provider. This is specified only
      when the provider is not the default provider.</p>
<p>HyperSQL works with any symmetric cipher that may be available
      from the JVM.</p>
<p>The files that are encrypted include the .script, .data, .backup
      and .log files. The .lobs file is not encrypted by default. The property
      crypt_lobs=true must be specified to encrypt the .lobs file.</p>

<p>General operations on an encrypted database are performed the same

      than with the equivalent cleartext database. With MEMORY tables, there
      is no difference to the speed of SELECT statements, but data change
      statements are slower. With CACHED tables, the speed of all statements
      is slower.</p>

<a name="N14133"></a>Security Considerations</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Security considerations for encrypted databases have been
      discussed at length in HSQLDB discussion groups. Development team
      members have commented that encryption is not a panacea for all security
      needs. The following issues should be taken into account:</p>
<p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Encrypted files are relatively safe in transport, but
            because databases contain many repeated values and words,
            especially known tokens such as CREATE, INSERT, etc., breaking the
            encryption of a database may be simpler than an unknown
            file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the files are encrypted, not the memory image. Poking
            into computer memory, while the database is open, will expose the
            contents of the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HyperSQL is open source. Someone who has the key, can
            compile and use a modified version of the program that saves a
            full cleartext dump of an encrypted database</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>Therefore encryption is generally effective only when
      the users who have access to the crypt key are trusted.</p>

<a name="N1415A"></a>Internal Event Monitoring</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL can log important internal events of the engine. These
      events occur during the operation of the engine, and are not always
      coupled with the exact type of statement being executed. Normal events
      such as opening and closing of files, or errors such as OutOfMemory
      conditions are examples of logged events.</p>
<p>HyperSQL supports two methods of logging. One method is specific
      to the individual database and is managed internally by HyperSQL. The
      other method is specific to JVM and is managed by a logging
      framework.</p>
<p>The internally-generated, individual log for the database can be
      enabled with the <code class="literal">SET DATABASE EVENT LOG LEVEL</code>
      statement, described in the next section. This method of logging is very
      useful for desktop application deployment, as it provides an ongoing
      record of database operations.</p>
<p>HyperSQL also supports log4J and JDK logging. The same event
      information that is passed to the internal log, is passed to external
      logging frameworks. These frameworks are configured outside HyperSQL.
      The log messages include the string "hsqldb.db." followed by the unique
      id (a 16 character string) of the database that generated the message,
      so they can be identified in a multi-database server context.</p>

<a name="N1416D"></a>Backward Compatibility Issues</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 conforms to the SQL Standard better than previous
    versions and has many more features. For these reasons, there may be some
    compatibility issues when converting old database, or using applications
    that were written for version 1.8.x or earlier. Some of the potential
    issues (and enhancements) are listed here.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>User names and passwords are case-sensitive. Check the .script
        file of a database for the correct case of user name and password and
        use this form in the connection properties or on connection
        URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is now possible to specify the admin username and password
        for a new database (instead of SA and the empty password).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 has several settings that relax its conformance to
        the SQL Standard in the areas of type conversion and object names.
        These settings can be turned on for maximum conformance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check constraints must conform to the SQL Standard. A check
        constraint is rejected if it is not deterministic or retrospectively
        deterministic. When opening an old database, HyperSQL silently drops
        check constraints that no longer compile. See under check constraints
        for more detail about what is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type declarations in column definition and in cast expressions
        must have the necessary size parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In connection with the above, an old database that did not have
        the <code class="literal">enforce_strict_size</code> property, is now converted
        to version 2.0 with the engine supplying the missing size parameters.
        For example, a VARCHAR column declaration that has no size, is given a
        32K size, a LONGVARCHAR column is given a 16MB size. Check these sizes
        are adequate for your use, and change the column definition as
        necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Column names in a GROUP BY clause were previously resolved to
        the column label. They are now resolved to column name first, and if
        the name does not match, to the column label.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two or more tables in a join contain columns with the same
        name, the columns cannot be referenced in join and where conditions.
        Use table names before column names to qualify the references to such
        columns. The <code class="literal">SET DATABASE SQL REFERENCES { TRUE | FALSE
        }</code> statement enables or disables this check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the unqualified wild card is used, as in the statement SELECT
        * FROM ... no additional column references are allowed. A
        table-qualified wild card allows additional column references in the
        SELECT list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table definitions containing <code class="literal">GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS
        IDENTITY</code> but with no <code class="literal">PRIMARY KEY</code> do not
        automatically create a primary key. Database .script files made with
        1.8 are fine, as the <code class="literal">PRIMARY KEY</code> clause is always
        included. But the <code class="literal">CREATE TABLE</code> statements in your
        application program may assume an automatic primary key is created.
        The old shortcut, IDENTITY, is retained with the same meaning. So
        <code class="literal">CREATE TABLE T (ID IDENTITY, DAT VARCHAR(20))</code> is
        translated into <code class="literal">CREATE TABLE T(ID INTEGER GENERATED BY
        DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, DAT VARCHAR(20))</code>. This last
        form is the correct way of defining both autoincrement and primary key
        in versions 1.8 and 2.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CREATE ALIAS is now obsolete. Use the new function definition
        syntax. The <code class="classname">org.hsqldb.Library </code>class no longer
        exists. You should use the SQL form of the old library functions. For
        example, use <code class="literal">LOG(x)</code> rather than the direct form,
        <code class="literal">"org.hsqldb.Library.log"(x)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The names of some commands for changing database and session
        properties have changed. See the list of statements in this
        chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computed columns in SELECT statements which did not have an
        alias: These columns had no ResultMetaData lebel in version 1.8, but
        in vresion 2.0, the engine generates labels such as C1, C2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue with the JDBC ResultSetMetaData methods,
        <code class="literal">getColumnName(int column)</code> and
        <code class="literal">getColumnLabel(int column)</code> has been clarified by
        the JDBC 4 specification. <code class="literal">getColumName()</code> returns
        the undelying column name, while <code class="literal">getColumnLabel()</code>
        returns any specified or generated alias. HyperSQL 1.8 and 2.0 have a
        connection property, <code class="literal">get_column_name</code>, which
        defaults to true in verision 2.0, but defaulted to false in some
        releases of version 1.8.x. You have to explicitly specify this
        property as false if you want (non-standard behaviour)
        <code class="literal">getColumnName()</code> to return the same value as

    HyperSQL, which have all been fixed in the latest version. Also, HyperSQL
    2.0 has been written to the SQL Standard and avoids the traps caused by
    superficial imitation of existing RDBMS. HyperSQL has many property
    settings that relax conformance to the Standard in order to allow
    compatibility with other RDBMS, without breaking the core integrity of the
    database. These properties are modified with SET DATABASE SQL statements
    described in the SQL Conformance Settings section of this chapter</p>
<p>The SQL Standard has existed since 1989 and has been expanded over
    the years in several revisions. Also, the X-Open specification has defined
    a number of SQL functions which are implemented by most RDBMS.</p>
<p>Each RDBMS supports additional functions that are not covered by the
    standard. Some RDBMS use non-standard syntax for some operations.
    Fortunately, most popular RDBMS products have introduced better
    compatibility with the Standard in their recent versions, but there are
    still some portability issues. HyperSQL overcomes the potability issues
    using these strategies</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">

<p>PostgreSQL is fairly compatible with the Standard, but uses some
      non-standard features.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Use MVCC if your application is multi-user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PostgreSQL functions are generally supported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code class="literal">&lt;set database sql syntax PGS
          statement&gt;</code> to enable the PostgreSQL's non-standard
          features. Support for SERIAL, BIGSERIAL and TEXT data types, as well
          as sequence functions are ttranslated into HSQLDB
          equivalents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For identity columns, PostgreSQL uses a non-standard linkage
          with an external identity sequence. In most cases, this can be
          converted to <code class="literal">GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY</code>. In
          those cases where the identity sequence needs to be shared by
          multiple tables, you can use a new HyperSQL 2.2 feature
          <code class="literal">GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS SEQUENCE &lt;sequence
          name&gt;</code>, which is the equivalent of the PostgreSQL
          implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CREATE TABLE statements, the SERIAL and BIGSERIAL types are
          translated into INTEGER or BIGINT, with <code class="literal">GENERATED BY

<li>
<p>In SELECT and other statements, the
          <code class="literal">NEXTVAL(&lt;sequence name&gt;)</code> and
          <code class="literal">LASTVAL()</code> functions are supported and translated

          expressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PostgreSQL uses a non-standard expression, <code class="literal">SELECT 'A

<a name="N1422D"></a>MySQL Compatibility</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>MySQL had many incompatibilities with the Standard. The latest
      versions have introduced much greater compatibly, but these features
      have to be turned on via properties. You should therefore check the
      current Standard compatibility settings of your MySQL database and use
      the available HyperSQL properties to achieve closer results. If you
      avoid the few anti-Standard features of MySQL you can port your
      databases to HyperSQL.</p>
<p>HyperSQL does not have the following non-standard limitations of
      MySQL.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Win HyperSQL, an UPDATE statement can update UNIQUE and
          PRIMARY KEY columns of a table without causing an exception due to
          temporary violation of constraints. These constraints are checked at
          the end of execution, therefore there is no need for an ORDER BY
          clause in an UPDATE statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MySQL foreign key constraints are not enforced by the default
          MyISAM engine. Be aware of the possibility of data being rejected by
          HyperSQL due to these constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With HyperSQL INSERT or UPDATE statements either succeed or
          fail due to constraint violation. MySQL has the non-standard IGNORE
          overrides to ignore violations, which is not accepted by
          HyperSQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike MySQL, HyperSQL allows you to modify a table with an
          INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement which selects from the same table
          in a subquery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Follow the guidelines below for converting MySQL databases and
      applications.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Avoid storing invalid values, for example invalid dates such
          as '0000-00-00' or '2001-00-00' which are rejected by
          HyperSQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid the MySQL feature that trims spaces at the end of CHAR
          values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use MVCC with <code class="literal">&lt;set database transaction control
          statement&gt;</code> if your application is multi-user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In MySQL, a database is the same as a schema. In HyperSQL
          several schemas can exist in the same database and accessed
          transparently. In addition a HyperSQL server supports multiple
          separate databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In MySQL, older, non-standard, forms of database object name
          case-sensitivity make is difficult to port applications. Use the
          latest form which encloses case-sensitive names in double
          quotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MySQL functions are generally supported, including
          GROUP_CONCAT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For fine control over type conversion, check the settings for
          <code class="literal">&lt;set database sql convert truncate
          statement&gt;</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use concatenation of possibly NULL values in your
          select statements, you may need to change the setting with the
          <code class="literal">&lt;set database sql concat nulls
          statement&gt;</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MySQL supports most SQL Standard types (except INTERVAL
          types), as well as non-standard types, which are also supported by
          HyperSQL. Supported types include SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, DOUBLE,
          FLOAT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, VARCHAR, CHAR, BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB,
          DATE, TIMESTAMP (all Standard SQL) and TINYINT, DATETIME (non
          Standard).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code class="literal">&lt;set database sql syntax MYS
          statement&gt;</code> to enable support for AUTO_INCREMENT and
          TEXT data types. These type definitions are translated into HSQLDB
          equivalents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MySQL uses a non-standard expression, <code class="literal">SELECT 'A Test
          String'</code> to return a single row table. The standard form is
          <code class="literal">VALUES('A Test String')</code>. In MYS syntax mode, this
          type of SELECT is supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL user-defined function and procedure syntax is very similar
          to SQL Standard syntax. A few changes may still be required.</p>

<li>
<p>You can define a system property to stop the database engine

<a name="N1431B"></a>Authentication Control</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Authentication is the mechanism that determines if a user can
      access the database at all. Once authentication is performed, the
      authorization mechanism is used to determine which database objects the
      particular user can access. The default authentication mechanism is
      password authentication. Each user is created with a password, which is
      stored in the database and checked each time a new database connection
      is created.</p>
<a name="N14320" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Password Complexity
      Check</strong></span>
</p>
<p>HyperSQL allows you to define a function that checks the quality
      of the passwords defined in the database. The passwords are stored in
      the database. Each time a user connects, the user's name and password
      are checked against the stored list of users and passwords. The
      connection attempt is rejected if there is no match.</p>
<a name="N1432B" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>
<span class="bold"><strong>External
      Authentication</strong></span>
</p>
<p>You can use an external authentication mechanism instead of the
      internal authentication mechanism. HyperSQL allows you to define a
      function that checks the combination of database unique name, user name,
      and password for each connection attempt. The function can use external
      resources to authenticate the user. For example, a directory server may
      be used. The password may be ignored if the external resource can verify
      the user's credential without it.</p>
<p>You can override external authentication for a user with the ALTER

</p>
<p>Older versions of HSQLDB perform a backup of the .data file
      before its contents are modified and the whole .data file is saved in a
      compressed form when a CHECKPOINT or SHUTDOWN is performed. This takes a
      long time when the size of the database exceeds 100 MB or so (on an
      average 2010 computer, you can expect a backup speed of 20MB per second
      or more).</p>
<p>The alternative is backup in increments, just before some part
      of the .data file is modified. In this mode, no backup is performed at
      CHECKPIONT or SHUTDOWN. This mode is preferred for large databases which
      are opened and closed frequently.</p>
<p>The default mode is <code class="literal">TRUE</code>. If the old method
      of backup is preferred, the mode can be set <code class="literal">FALSE</code>.
      This is equivalent to the connection property
      <code class="literal">hsqldb.inc_backup</code>.</p>
<p>Warning: The old, non-incremental setting, FALSE, shouldn't be
      used at all when the data file is larger than 4GB. If it is used, the
      data file is not fully backed up and can result in corruption. The zip

<p>Set the WRITE DELAY property of the database. The WRITE DELAY

      WRITE DELAY TRUE performs the sync once every 0.5 seconds (which is the
      default). A numeric value can be specified instead.</p>
<p>The purpose of this command is to control the amount of data loss
      in case of a total system crash. A delay of 1 second means at most the
      data written to disk during the last second before the crash is lost.
      All data written prior to this has been synced and should be

<p>A write delay of 0 impacts performance in high load situations, as
